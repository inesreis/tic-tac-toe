# 🧠 Tic-Tac-Toe (React + TypeScript)

This is a feature-rich and scalable Tic-Tac-Toe game built in **React** with **TypeScript**, modern **testing frameworks**, and enhanced UI/UX. It started as a simple tutorial project and evolved as I learned new React concepts, testing practices, and development workflows.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test
```
